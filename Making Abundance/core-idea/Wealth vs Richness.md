Wealth: the absolute amount that a person has. Their opportunities and options, what they can do, what they have the privilege of not having to think about. For example, a person with free health care that simply works has high wealth, and a person who has to worry about losing health care or about uncovered services has lower wealth.
Richness: the relative difference between your Wealth and that of those around you. You are rich if your Wealth is much higher than theirs, and Poor if it is much lower. Because this is a relative scale, it varies greatly. For example, the richest people in the time of the Tudors were, by many measures, less Wealthy than the common Poor in most of the modern West. Today's Poor have higher health, better food, easier access to transportation and choice of location, warmer houses, and a much wider variety of manufactured goods and entertainments.
The Abundance Movement actively seeks to maximize Wealth by minimizing Richness. In a truly Abundant society, there is no concept of richness. After all, when everyone has whatever they want (maximum wealth), then no one is more wealthy than anyone else. This is achieved by driving each good or service through the abundance stage model, until it is abundant or free. And then having each person contribute some of their time, skill, etc in order to be able to participate fully in the wealth.
