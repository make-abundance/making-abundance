# Expansion Model and Bootstrap Strategy

How the Abundance Movement grows from initial creation to self-sustaining flywheel.

---

## The Tiered Expansion Model

Growth happens in tiers. Each tier must be established before the next becomes practical.

### Core Tier (First)

The minimum needed to get the flywheel spinning. Must accomplish three purposes:
1. **Start a flywheel** for internal economic advantage
2. **Produce something immediately valuable to participants** (cheap food, reduced cost of living)
3. **Produce something immediately valuable to states** (services they need at lower cost)

| Industry | Member Value | State Value | Why Core |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Food** | Reduces cost of living | Institutional food (schools, prisons, hospitals) | Most fundamental need. High visibility. |
| **IT Services** | Shared infrastructure | Government SaaS, modernization, cyber | Near-zero marginal cost. Immediate state need. No logistics. |
| **Energy** | Cheap power for members | PPAs for state buildings | Already cheapest. Established procurement. |
| **Media / Journalism** | Community connection | (indirect—legitimacy, narrative) | Enrollment engine. Non-negotiable for growth. |

See [[State Budget Analysis - What States Need]] for detailed research on state spending.

**The media/story function is not optional.** The movement grows through enrollment. Enrollment requires:
- People understanding what abundance means
- People seeing it working
- People having a path to join

This makes journalism/media as critical as food production.

**State value proposition**: IT services, energy, and institutional food represent areas where states spend heavily, current vendors extract profit, and abundance can deliver dramatically lower costs. These are the door-openers.

### Second Tier

Industries that improve quality of life and deepen the abundance offering, but aren't strictly necessary for survival or growth.

| Industry | Why Second Tier |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Education** | Transmits the mission. Creates next generation of contributors. But movement can start with informal education. |
| **Luxury Services** | Makes abundance attractive. Demonstrates that abundance isn't austerity. |
| **Healthcare** | Critical for members, but complex to bootstrap. Requires scale. |
| **Housing** | High capital requirements. Can start with members finding their own housing. |

**Education on core mission** is a second-tier priority that becomes essential as the movement scales. It's how you solve the socialization problem identified in [[Lessons from Existing Implementations]].

### Later Tiers

Everything else. Expand based on:
- Member demand (what do people want to become abundant?)
- Strategic value (what unlocks other industries?)
- Opportunity (what businesses want to join?)

## The BYO Business Expansion Model

Primary growth mechanism: **Bring Your Own Business**

Rather than building every capability from scratch, the movement grows by welcoming existing businesses that want to transition to abundance.

### How It Works

1. **Business owner wants out of scarcity extraction** (burnout, values conflict, succession planning, etc.)
2. **Business converts to steward ownership** within the abundance federation
3. **Business offers two-tier pricing**: Scarcity Market Price for outsiders, Abundance Price for members
4. **Business gains access to abundance network**: cheap inputs from other federated businesses, shared services, member customers
5. **Business owner becomes member**: Gets stipend, loses ownership extraction, gains community

### Why This Works

- Solves bootstrap problem: Existing businesses have revenue, customers, capabilities
- Reduces risk for joiners: They're betting their existing business, not starting from zero
- Accelerates diversification: Each business brings new capabilities to the network
- Creates enrollment pipeline: Every business owner knows other business owners

### Requirements for Joining

- Convert to non-acquirable ownership structure (see [[Operational Defenses Against Scarcity Behavior]])
- Commit to two-tier pricing
- Participate in governance (consent rights come with obligations)
- Undergo socialization process (understand the mission, not just sign papers)

---

## The Bootstrap Strategy: Public-Private Partnership

### The Opportunity

Current political situation in the US creates an opening:
- Blue state governors in conflict with federal administration
- States need operational capabilities but want to reduce federal dependence
- Traditional tax-based funding sends money to federal government first
- States are looking for alternatives

### The Value Proposition to States

**For the state**:
- Abundance pricing on operational needs (cheaper than market)
- Services provided by organizations that can't be acquired by hostile actors
- Reduced money flowing through federal taxation
- Political alignment with values-based economy

**For the movement**:
- Initial scale and legitimacy
- Guaranteed customer base
- Access to infrastructure and resources
- Proof of concept at meaningful scale

### How It Reduces Federal Tax Flow

The abundance model shifts compensation from personal income to:
- Stipends (structured differently from wages)
- Direct provision of goods/services (not taxable income)
- Contribution-based access (not market transactions)

This means:
- Less taxable personal income generated
- Less payroll tax
- Less flows through federal system
- More stays in local/state economy

**Note**: This requires careful legal structuring. The goal is legitimate tax efficiency, not evasion. The structure must be defensible.

### What States Get

| State Need | Abundance Offering |
|------------|-------------------|
| IT services | Provided at abundance price by federated tech businesses |
| Food for institutions | From abundance agriculture network |
| Energy | From abundance solar/storage network |
| Media/communications | From abundance journalism network |
| Professional services | From federated member businesses |

### What the Movement Gets

| Movement Need | State Provides |
|---------------|----------------|
| Scale | Large contracts create baseline demand |
| Legitimacy | Government partnership signals trustworthiness |
| Infrastructure | Access to land, buildings, utilities |
| Regulatory support | Favorable treatment for new ownership structures |
| Political cover | Protection from federal interference |

## The Bootstrap Sequence

### Phase 1: Founding Core

1. Identify initial committed members (high-trust, values-aligned)
2. Identify initial businesses willing to convert (BYO Business)
3. Establish legal structure (steward ownership, purpose trust)
4. Create minimal viable governance (sociocratic circles)
5. Build media/story capacity immediately (this is core, not optional)

### Phase 2: State Partnership

1. Identify receptive blue state governors/officials
2. Develop specific value proposition for their needs
3. Structure initial contracts at abundance pricing
4. Use state contracts to prove model works
5. Document and publicize success

### Phase 3: Flywheel Activation

Once core tier is established with state backing:
- Members' cost of living drops (food, energy from network)
- Scarcity market revenue funds expansion
- Success stories attract new BYO Businesses
- New businesses expand network capabilities
- Expanded capabilities attract more members
- More members = more demand = more businesses want to join

### Phase 4: Second Tier Expansion

Once flywheel is spinning:
- Add education (formal transmission of mission)
- Add luxury services (demonstrate abundance isn't austerity)
- Expand to new geographies
- Federate as scale requires

## Media Governance: Preventing Capture

Media/journalism is core tier—essential for enrollment and narrative. But this creates a capture risk: whoever controls the story has disproportionate influence. Here's how to prevent that.

### Principle 1: Sociocratic Governance (Like Everything Else)

Media circles operate under the same consent-based governance as all other circles:
- No editorial hierarchy that can be captured
- Decisions about direction/policy require consent
- Any member can block decisions that harm the mission
- Role rotation applies to editorial roles too

This means no single editor or group can steer narrative without consent.

### Principle 2: Highly Distributed Content Creation

**Central group provides**:
- The medium/platform (infrastructure)
- Quality standards and requirements (what counts as good journalism)
- Training and support for contributors
- Coordination across distributed creators

**Central group does NOT provide**:
- The content itself
- Editorial direction on what stories to tell
- Approval/veto over individual pieces (beyond quality standards)

Content comes from many contributors across the network. No bottleneck where capture could occur.

### Principle 3: The Evergrey Model (Curiosity-Driven Journalism)

Based on [The Evergrey](https://www.seattlemet.com/news-and-city-life/2018/01/anika-anand-and-monica-guzman-are-on-a-mission-to-build-community-in-seattle) in Seattle and similar publications:

**What it is**:
- "Conversational journalism"—engages readers, doesn't just broadcast
- Focuses on community building, not page views
- Helps people make sense of their world, not just consume information
- Quote: "Journalism can do more than just source information. It can guide people through it, connect the dots, help different people and communities come together."

**How it works**:
1. **Start with curiosity**: What questions do people actually have?
2. **Engage with core questions**: Don't assume you know what matters—ask
3. **Research and provide good answers**: Depth over speed
4. **Connect people to each other**: The goal is community, not audience

**Why this resists capture**:
- Content driven by reader questions, not editorial agenda
- Success measured by community connection, not narrative dominance
- Decentralized distribution (newsletters, social, events—not one channel)
- No display advertising (removes advertiser capture risk)

### Structural Safeguards

| Risk | Defense |
|------|---------|
| Editorial capture | Role rotation for editorial positions; consent-based editorial policy |
| Narrative monopoly | Multiple independent media circles, not one central outlet |
| Platform capture | Decentralized distribution; no single channel dependence |
| Advertiser capture | No display advertising; revenue from abundance network, not external advertisers |
| Algorithm capture | Direct relationships (email, events) over algorithmic platforms |

### What "Success" Looks Like

The media function succeeds when:
- New people understand what abundance means (enrollment)
- Existing members feel connected to the mission (retention)
- Questions and concerns surface and get addressed (transparency)
- The movement's story is told by many voices, not one (distribution)

It fails when:
- One voice dominates the narrative
- Content becomes propaganda rather than journalism
- Reader questions are ignored in favor of predetermined messaging
- The media circle accumulates disproportionate influence

## Communication Functions: Split by Purpose

Media, education, and communication are not one thing. They serve different purposes and use different approaches.

### Function 1: Storytelling (Outward-Facing)

**Purpose**: Enrollment. Help people outside the movement understand what abundance is and why they might want to join.

**Approach**: Evergrey model (see above)
- Curiosity-driven
- Community-focused
- Questions from audience, not editorial agenda

**Audience**: People who don't yet know about or understand the movement.

---

### Function 2: Behavior Training (Inward-Facing)

**Purpose**: Transmission. Help members learn the behaviors that make abundance work.

**Approach**: [Green Path](https://www.marianhartman.com/) (Marian Hartman's behavior-first change method)

**Core principle**: Align on behaviors, not beliefs. Individual freedom to create your own theory/narrative—we don't require you to think a certain way. We align on:
- The behaviors that work
- The behaviors we want to share
- Observable, repeatable actions

**How it works** (from Green Path):
- Behavior-first, not theory-first
- Give people "recipes"—steps they can follow exactly to achieve results
- Make progress visible through micro-behaviors
- Meet people where they're at
- Change sticks because it's grounded in action, not ideology

**Why this matters for abundance**:
- Avoids ideological capture (we're not a belief system)
- Respects individual autonomy (think what you want, do what works)
- Creates alignment without conformity
- Makes onboarding concrete, not abstract
- Addresses the socialization problem from [[Lessons from Existing Implementations]]—transmits culture through practice, not indoctrination

**Examples of abundance behaviors** (to be developed):
- How to participate in consent-based decisions
- How to raise objections constructively
- How to use the two-tier pricing system
- How to contribute within your circle
- How to rotate roles effectively

**Handling "fuzzy" behaviors**:

Some behaviors are clear and repeatable (consent process, pricing use). Others are fuzzier (recognizing when you're drifting toward scarcity thinking, knowing when to block).

**Proposed approach**: Core shared stories + keystone behaviors

- **Shared stories**: Narratives that illustrate the principle in action. Not ideology—examples that show what the behavior looks like and why it matters. People create their own theory/narrative from the stories.
- **Keystone behaviors**: The few observable actions that, if done consistently, indicate alignment. Not comprehensive—just the critical few that make the fuzzy concrete.

Example: "Recognizing drift toward scarcity thinking"
- **Shared story**: The Fagor failure—what it looked like when job security replaced mission commitment
- **Keystone behavior**: In any decision discussion, ask "Does this increase or decrease abundance for members?" If you can't answer, pause.

*[TO BE TESTED: Does this combination actually work for fuzzy behaviors? Need to pilot.]*

---

### Function 3: Community Connection (Inward-Facing)

**Purpose**: Retention and transparency. Help members feel connected, surface concerns, answer questions.

**Approach**: Evergrey model adapted for internal audience
- What questions do members actually have?
- What's working? What's not?
- Connect members to each other, not just to central narrative

**Audience**: Existing members.

---

### Function 4: Science Communication (Later Tier)

**Purpose**: Spread real science, dispel fakes. Combat misinformation that undermines abundance (e.g., climate denial, anti-renewable propaganda).

**Approach**: TBD—this is complex and requires careful design to avoid becoming propaganda itself.

**Timing**: Later tier. Not core to getting flywheel started, but becomes important as movement scales and faces organized opposition.

**Risk**: Easy to slide from "spreading real science" to "enforcing orthodoxy." Must maintain behavior-first principle—we align on what works, not on what you must believe.

---

### Summary: Communication Functions

| Function | Direction | Purpose | Approach |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Storytelling | Outward | Enrollment | Evergrey (curiosity-driven) |
| Behavior Training | Inward | Transmission | Green Path (behavior-first) |
| Community Connection | Inward | Retention | Evergrey adapted |
| Science Communication | Outward | Counter-misinfo | TBD (later tier) |

Each function is a separate circle (or set of circles) with its own governance, preventing any single communication function from dominating.

## Open Questions

1. **Access to governors**: How do you get in the room? Who has relationships? What's the pitch that opens doors?

2. **Legal structure for tax efficiency**: What specific structures achieve the tax flow reduction while remaining legally defensible?

3. **First businesses**: Which specific businesses/industries should be first to convert? What's the ideal profile?

4. **Minimum viable scale**: How many members/businesses before the flywheel starts turning? What's the threshold?

5. **Geographic focus**: Start in one state and deepen, or spread across multiple states quickly?
