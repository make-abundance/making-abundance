# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

This is **not a codebase**. It is an Obsidian vault containing thought leadership documents for the **Abundance Movement** - a framework for restructuring organizations (companies/movements) to maximize collective Wealth rather than concentrating Richness among owners.

## Repository Structure

## Core Concepts

When working with these documents, understand these foundational distinctions:

- **Wealth vs Richness**: Wealth is absolute (what you have, your options). Richness is relative (how much more you have than others). The movement maximizes Wealth by minimizing Richness.

- **Four-Stage Model**: Goods/services progress through: Scarce → Artificially Scarce → Abundant → Free

- **The Core Engine**: Energy (solar), human labor (robotics/drones), human thought (AI), and raw materials are all now achievable in abundance. The remaining constraint is company ownership distribution.

- **Kindness as Competitive Edge**: Two-tier pricing (Scarcity Market Price vs Abundance Price). People buy into abundance through contribution, not cash.

- **Sociocratic Governance**: No hierarchy, no positional authority. Decisions by Consent, not consensus or power. Equal stipends ($10k scarcity dollars/month) with required spending categories.

## Working With This Content

- Documents use Obsidian's wikilink format `[[Document Name]]` for internal links
- Maintain the distinction between Wealth (absolute) and Richness (relative) throughout
- New documents should go in `core-idea/` if they establish foundational concepts, or at the vault root for applications/examples
- The ideas are interconnected; consider cross-references when adding or editing content
