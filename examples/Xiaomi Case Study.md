### Key Insight
Xiaomi demonstrates that the infrastructure for rapid, automated manufacturing already exists. A company with no automotive experience produced a competitive EV at scale in under 3 years by leveraging the ecosystem. The constraint was not technology—it was decision-making speed and access to the supply chain.
