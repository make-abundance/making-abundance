## What Protects Against External Acquisition

### The Bosch Model (Foundation Ownership)

**Structure**:
- Robert Bosch Stiftung (Foundation) owns **94% of shares** but has **no voting rights**
- Robert Bosch Industrietreuhand KG holds **93% of voting rights** but only **0.01% of shares**
- Voting shares held by 10 steward-owners who cannot sell or inherit them—passed to next generation of stewards

**Why it works**:
- Economic value separated from control
- No one can accumulate enough voting power to force a sale
- Foundation uses dividends for charitable purposes (aligned with founder's intent)
- Company insulated from short-term market pressure

### The Patagonia Model (Purpose Trust)

**Structure**:
- **Patagonia Purpose Trust** owns 2% of company (all voting stock)
- **Holdfast Collective** (nonprofit) owns 98% of company (all non-voting stock)
- Purpose Trust exists solely to protect company values and mission
- Trust controls board appointments and charter changes

**Why it works**:
- Voting power held by trust with legally binding purpose
- Cannot be sold because trust's purpose is to prevent sale
- Profits flow to climate nonprofit, not to individuals who could be bought out
- Chouinard family maintains influence through trust governance (for now)

**Rejected alternatives**:
- Sale: New owners might not maintain values
- IPO: "Listed companies are under too much pressure to create short-term gain"

### The Steward Ownership Pattern

**Core principles** (legally binding):
1. **Self-governance**: Control stays with people actively involved in business
2. **Purpose-driven profit**: Profits reinvested or used for mission, not extracted

**Implementation models**:
- Foundation ownership (Bosch, Zeiss)
- Purpose/perpetual trusts (Patagonia, Organically Grown Company)
- Golden share/veto share (Ecosia, Sharetribe)
- Cooperative structures

**Scale**: 100+ European companies, growing in US. Zeiss operating 100+ years.

## What Causes Degeneration (Loss of Democratic Culture)

### The Mondragon/Fagor Failure

**What happened**:
- Fagor Electrodomésticos was Mondragon's founding cooperative (1956)
- Filed bankruptcy 2013 with $1.5 billion debt
- 37% sales decline since 2007 (Spanish economic crisis)
- Unable to compete with low-cost Asian imports

**Internal factors that contributed**:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Nepotistic hiring | Preferred hiring children of members; created entitlement |
| Absenteeism | Rose from 4% to 8% in a decade—higher than private Spanish companies |
| Failed transmission | Younger members didn't absorb cooperative culture |
| Overexpansion | 18 plants across 6 countries became burden |
| Two-tier workforce | Full members (1,900) vs wage laborers (3,700)—democracy didn't extend to all |

**What Mondragon did right**:
- Internal insurance paid 80% salary for 2 years
- Relocated most full members to other cooperatives
- But: wage laborers simply lost jobs

**Key lesson**: "Clear decoupling between Mondragon's principles and the daily activity of the worker members. The strongest tie binding them was job security, not closeness to cooperative culture."

### The Degeneration Thesis (General Pattern)

**Meister's Four-Stage Model**:

1. **Conquest**: Direct democracy, high idealism, small cohesive group, unclear structures
2. **Economic Consolidation**: Conventional organization develops, idealism decreases, manager vs idealist conflicts
3. **Coexistence**: Loses radical ideals, accepts market values
4. **Administrative Power**: Original spirit diluted, routinized, specialized managers emerge

**Three forms of degeneration**:
- **Constitutional**: Employees excluded from membership
- **Organizational**: Decision-making centralizes
- **Cultural**: Cooperative ethos lost in pursuit of profit

**Root causes**:
- Demands for efficiency, productivity, rapid market response
- Informal elites develop who act as de facto managers but are unaccountable
- Greater size → complexity → less participation
- "Ritualization" of democratic spaces—become symbolic rather than substantive

### John Lewis Partnership Under Pressure

**Current situation**:
- £234m loss (2023)
- Considering diluting employee ownership to raise £1-2 billion external investment
- Would require partnership council approval

**Governance tensions identified by research**:
- Management and workers have different visions of "partnership"
- Recent changes diluted employees' decision-making power
- "Managers accountable to Partners but not controlled by them"
- A proposal to remove voting rights was rejected—but by fine margin

**Key insight**: "Competing interests between management and employees shape the evolving meanings of participation."

## What Protects Against Degeneration

### From Cooperative Research

**Strong shared ideology** is the best bulwark, but requires constant vigilance as cooperatives grow.

**Specific practices that help**:

| Practice | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Job rotation** | Democratizes expertise, improves communication, prevents informal elites |
| **Thorough socialization** | New members deeply absorb values, not just sign forms |
| **Cooperative education/training** | Ongoing, not just onboarding |
| **Common recruitment** | Hire for values alignment, not just skills |
| **Induction procedures** | Formal process for transmitting culture |

**Cornforth's finding**: "All successful cooperatives in his study used job rotation... even as they grew."

### From Sociocracy

**Consent vs Consensus**:
- Consent = "no objections" (based on ability to work toward aims)
- Proposal moves forward when "good enough for now, safe enough to try"
- Faster than consensus, which seeks full agreement

**Key patterns**:
- Clear roles prevent informal power accumulation
- Rounds for sharing perspectives ensure all voices heard
- Double-linking between circles creates accountability without hierarchy

**Where it's used**:
- Intentional communities (cohousing, ecovillages)
- Nonprofits
- Worker cooperatives
- Schools
- Some tech startups and manufacturing companies

**Results reported**: Higher employee engagement, faster conflict resolution, better adaptability.

## Lessons for the Four Tensions

### Tension 1: Consent vs Speed

**From Mondragon**: They competed successfully for 50+ years. Speed came from:
- Circles/cooperatives have autonomy within their domain
- Not everything goes to full assembly
- Federation structure allows local speed with system-wide coherence

**From Sociocracy**: Consent is actually faster than consensus because you only need "no objections," not full agreement.

**Key insight**: The speed problem is often a scope problem. If decisions that should be local are being made globally, the system is misconfigured.

### Tension 2: The Bootstrap Problem

**From Mondragon**:
- Started with a technical school (education first)
- Father Arizmendiarrieta built relationships for years before first cooperative
- Created credit union (Caja Laboral) early to provide financing
- First members were facing unemployment—high motivation to try something new

**From Bosch/Patagonia**:
- Both converted existing successful businesses
- Founder maintained control during transition
- Transition happened gradually over decades (Bosch) or all at once with founder alive (Patagonia)

**Key insight**: Two paths—(1) build slowly with high-commitment early members facing real need, or (2) convert an existing business whose founder wants to preserve values.

---

### Tension 3: Contribution Definition

**From Mondragon**:
- Original: Clear contribution = labor in the cooperative
- Problem: Created two-tier system (members vs wage laborers)
- Problem: Children of members felt entitled regardless of contribution

**From cooperatives generally**:
- Too narrow → excludes people, creates second-class status
- Too broad → free rider problem, resentment

**Key insight**: Contribution must be clearly defined AND the definition must evolve with the organization. Job rotation helps because everyone understands multiple forms of contribution.

---

### Tension 4: The Removal Paradox

**From John Lewis**:
- Constitution protects employees from removal
- But also makes it hard to remove underperformers
- This creates resentment and erodes democratic commitment

**From sociocracy**:
- Consent-based removal possible
- The accused doesn't have blocking power over their own removal
- But requires clear evidence of harm to purpose (not just disagreement)

**From Mondragon/Fagor**:
- Failed to remove/reform Fagor even when it was clearly failing
- Federation structure meant other cooperatives eventually refused to keep funding
- This was painful but preserved the system

**Key insight**: The ability to exit (at individual, unit, or federation level) may be as important as formal removal processes. If a unit can't be reformed, the system must be able to let it fail without taking everything down.

## Summary: What the Evidence Says

### Structures that prevent acquisition (high confidence):
- Foundation ownership with separated voting/economic rights
- Purpose trusts with legally binding mission
- Steward ownership with non-transferable voting shares

### Practices that prevent degeneration (moderate confidence):
- Job rotation (democratizes expertise)
- Deep socialization of new members
- Ongoing cooperative education
- Consent-based governance (faster than consensus)
- Nested circles with clear domains (prevents bottlenecks)
- Transparency (prevents informal elites)

### Warning signs of degeneration:
- Democratic spaces becoming "ritualized" or symbolic
- Rising absenteeism or disengagement
- Two-tier membership (some have voice, others don't)
- Informal elites making de facto decisions
- New members not absorbing culture
- "Job security" becoming primary motivation over mission

### What remains uncertain:
- Optimal size before splitting/federating
- How to bootstrap without existing resources or converting existing business
- How to maintain speed while scaling consent
- How to define contribution broadly without losing meaning
