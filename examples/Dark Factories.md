# Dark Factories (Lights-Out Manufacturing)

## Raw Data with Sources

### Definition
"Dark factories" are production sites where machines handle every task—assembly, inspection, and logistics—eliminating the need for human presence. Without workers, there's no need for lighting, heating, or breaks, reducing energy costs and boosting efficiency.

### Western Executive Reactions
- **Ford CEO Jim Farley**: "the most humbling thing I've ever seen... if we lose this, we do not have a future at Ford"
- Farley has been driving a Xiaomi SU7 for 6 months: "I don't want to give it up"
- **Greg Jackson (Octopus Energy)**: "We visited a dark factory producing some astronomical number of mobile phones. The process was so heavily automated that there were no workers on the manufacturing side."
- **Andrew Forrest (Fortescue)**: "I can take you to factories now, where you'll basically be alongside a big conveyor... after about 800, 900 metres, a truck drives out. There are no people – everything is robotic."

### European Examples
- **Siemens Amberg (Germany)**: Almost entirely lights-out, **99.99885% quality rate**
- **Philips (Netherlands)**: 128 robots producing **15 million electric razors/year**, humans only for QA

### Policy Driver
- "Made in China 2025" initiative (launched 2015)
- "Jiqi huanren" policy ("replacing humans with machines") - tax breaks reimbursing 20% of industrial robot spending
