# Solar Energy Costs

## Raw Data with Sources

### Global Costs
- Global weighted average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of utility-scale solar plants: **$0.043/kWh in 2024**
- Solar photovoltaics were **41% cheaper than the lowest-cost fossil fuel** alternatives in 2024

### China-Specific
- National average bus-bar price in China: **0.34 CNY/kWh (4.93 US cents/kWh)** as of 2020
- Tibet grid (lowest): 0.29 CNY/kWh (4.20 US cents/kWh)
- Central China (highest): 0.43 CNY/kWh (6.23 US cents/kWh)

### Future Projections
- Solar power with storage projected to supply 43.2% of China's demand in 2060 at **under 2.5 US cents/kWh**
- National average projected to decrease from 0.25 CNY/kWh (3.62 US cents/kWh) in 2030 to **0.12 CNY/kWh (1.74 US cents/kWh) in 2060**

### China vs. US/West
- Solar systems in China: **40-60% lower costs** than Western markets
- Higher costs persist in Europe and North America due to permitting delays, limited grid capacity, and higher balance-of-system expenses

### Battery Storage (Critical Complement)
- Cost of core BESS equipment fell **40% in 2024** vs 2023, reaching record low of **$165/kWh**
- All-in capex for utility-scale battery storage outside US/China: ~$125/kWh ($75 equipment + $50 installation)
- US costs higher due to tariffs: $100/kWh or more for core equipment
