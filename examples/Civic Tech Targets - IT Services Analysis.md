### 3. Nava PBC (Washington DC) - LARGER, HARDER

## No Longer Available

### OpenGov
Was a strong candidate (1,900+ government clients, California roots, public benefit focused) but **acquired by Cox Enterprises in February 2024 for $1.8B**. No longer independent.

---

## Worker-Owned Tech Cooperatives

Less government contract experience, but structurally aligned:

| Cooperative | Location | Focus |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| CoTech | UK | Network of 40+ tech co-ops |
| The Developer Society | UK | Digital services for charities/NGOs |
| Outlandish | London | Worker-owned, works with Islington Council |

US tech co-ops exist but are smaller and less government-focused. Could be partners rather than conversion targets.

## Procurement Pathway Notes

The user noted government procurement is painful. Options to reduce friction:

### 1. Acquire Company with Existing Contract Vehicles
Companies like Skylight and Nava already have:
- GSA Schedule contracts
- Agency-specific BPAs (Blanket Purchase Agreements)
- SBIR/STTR vehicles
- State-specific master contracts

Acquiring or partnering with them means inheriting these vehicles.

### 2. Cooperative Purchasing Programs
States allow local governments to "piggyback" on state contracts. If you get one state contract, others can use it.

### 3. Technology Marketplaces
Cities like San Francisco have pre-approved vendor lists (Exygy is on SF's). Getting on these lists enables faster procurement.

### 4. Subcontracting
Partner with existing prime contractors (Carahsoft, etc.) as a subcontractor. They handle procurement; you deliver work.

## Recommendation

**Tier 1 conversation targets**:

1. **Exygy** - Small, B-Corp, SF-based, products aligned with abundance values, already proving civic tech can generate revenue. Could be a genuine values conversation.

2. **Skylight** - USDS alumni understand the mission, distributed team, medium size, established contract vehicles. Might be interested in a new model.

**Tier 2** (longer shot):

3. **Nava** - If they were interested, instant scale and credibility. Worth a conversation but expect them to be happy with current trajectory.

**Alternative path**:

If no acquisition target works, **build from scratch** using:
- Your software development capability
- AI to accelerate development (near-zero marginal cost)
- Partner with existing contract holder for procurement access
- Target one state, prove model, expand

The "build" path is slower but maintains full control over structure from day one.

## Open Questions

1. **Who knows people at these companies?** Warm intros matter.

2. **What would conversion look like?** Do they become a circle within the abundance federation? A subsidiary? A partner?

3. **What's the pitch?** "Convert to steward ownership and join a federation" is abstract. Need concrete value proposition for founders/employees.

4. **What do their current investors/owners want?** Exygy and Skylight may have outside investors with expectations.
