### AI Acceleration
- FANUC partnering with NVIDIA for AI platform
- Deep learning application: What took **1 robot 8 hours** can now be done by **8 robots in 1 hour** (learning together)
- Quote from board member Kiyonori Inaba: "Advances in artificial intelligence will allow robots to watch, learn and improve their capabilities."

### Tesla (US) - Emerging

#### Optimus Robot Factory
- Building dedicated facility at Giga Texas
- Target capacity: **up to 10 million humanoid robots/year**
- CEO Musk (Q3 2025): "A production line that has a capacity of 1 million Optimus robots will be built"
- Strategy: "Robots building robots" - closed-loop ecosystem

#### Current State
- 2025 target: "several thousand" Optimus robots
- 2026 target: 50,000-100,000 units
- As of mid-2025: Only "hundreds" built (behind pace)
- Optimus bots deployed at Giga Texas for tasks like sorting battery cells

#### Existing Factory Automation
- Fremont factory: ~200 robots of varying sizes and complexities
- Some can lift entire cars, others perform delicate tasks and switch tools
- Acquired German automation company Manz AG assets (December 2024): 300 employees + plant

### Key Insight
The self-replicating aspect is crucial: robots that build robots create exponential scaling potential. Once the initial investment is made, expansion costs drop dramatically as the system reproduces itself.
